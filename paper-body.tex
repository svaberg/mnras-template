\section{Introduction}

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we show this by comparing instantaneous wind torque \(\dot J_\Wind\) of our models to a simple observation-based gyrotrack model based on the work of
The resulting wind torques do however need to be scaled by a factor of \(\sim 7\) in order to yield s presented in Section~\ref{sec:Discussion}.
In Section~\ref{sec:Conclusions} we present our conclusions.
